# AEC_Hackathon_2016
Team Build Up entryfor AEC Hackathon Helsinki-2 2016

Entry is mainly a webpage and a PowerPoint show about the idea of using drones to photograph the future views people would have from their window.
In the page you can scroll up and down the images from different floor by moving your mouse over the picture.

Specially in high buildings people buy their appartments for the view, and what would be better way to get involved with the new appartment then with a preview of your future view?
This method could also be used to decide where windows should point in the building, and therefore support the design process of a building.
